  - I know you have many questions.
  - All will be answered soon.
  - But right now, I need you to kill those robots and get me their energy!
  - You can press left click to swing your saber. Your health is visible in the top
    right corner, along with my energy bar.
  - "If you ever are low on health, press Q and I will heal you by using up some
    of my energy. Don\u2019t die!"
  fillers:
  - Thank you.
  - Right, I forgot to tell you.
  - "Name\u2019s Max by the way."
  - I have a limited amount of energy, so I constantly need energy to keep living.
  - "Now, go into that portal to reach the hub and I\u2019ll tell you more."
